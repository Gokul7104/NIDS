# NETWORK INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 OVERVIEW
The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a sophisticated security solution designed to monitor network traffic in real-time and detect potential security threats. This system employs machine learning algorithms to analyze network packets, identify anomalies, and alert administrators to potential security breaches.

2 SYSTEM STUDY
2.1 EXISTING SYSTEM
Traditional network security systems often rely on signature-based detection methods, which have several limitations:
- Can only detect known threats
- Regular updates required for new threat signatures
- Unable to detect zero-day attacks
- High false positive rates
- Limited ability to detect complex attack patterns
- Resource-intensive signature matching

2.2 PROPOSED SYSTEM
Our modern NIDS addresses these limitations through:
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Real-time traffic analysis
- Advanced threat scoring system
- Automated alert generation
- Performance optimization
- Scalable architecture
- Low false positive rates through ML model training
- Zero-day attack detection capabilities

2.3 FRONTEND
The frontend is built using modern web technologies:
- React for component-based UI development
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Recharts for real-time data visualization
- TensorFlow.js for client-side ML inference

2.4 BACKEND PYTHON
The backend system utilizes Python for:
- Network packet capture and analysis
- Feature extraction from network traffic
- ML model training and validation
- Real-time threat detection
- Alert generation and management
- System health monitoring

2.5 MYSQL SERVER
The database system handles:
- Network traffic logs
- Detection results
- System status metrics
- Alert history
- ML model metadata
- Performance metrics

3 SYSTEM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
3.1 FILE DESIGN
The project follows a modular architecture:

```

3.2 INPUT DESIGN
The system processes various inputs:
- Network packets
- System performance metrics
- User configuration settings
- ML model parameters
- Alert thresholds

3.3 OUTPUT DESIGN
Outputs are presented through:
- Real-time dashboards
- Threat detection alerts
- System status reports
- Performance metrics

3.4 DATABASE DESIGN
While the current implementation does not use a database, a potential database design would include:
